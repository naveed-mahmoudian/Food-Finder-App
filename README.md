# Food Finder

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for making this project was to create an app that would find restaurants near you when an address is entered. The user will get a list of of restaurants and may sort by name, address, distance and price.
- The team built this project because it would be useful to use when you are not familiar with an area. Maybe to used on vacation or a new city that you have moved to.
- This solves the problem of not knowing what restaurants are available in the area you are currently visiting.
- We learned that there are many ways to do different things and that communication and teamwork are the most important part when working on a group project.

## Technologies Used
